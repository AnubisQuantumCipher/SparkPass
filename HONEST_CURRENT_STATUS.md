# Honest Current Verification Status - SparkPass

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Current Level:** **Silver+ (NOT Gold)**
**Status:** In progress toward Gold Level

---

## Correction to Previous Claims

**RETRACTED:** The claim "Gold Level ACHIEVED" was incorrect.

**Reality:** SparkPass currently has:
-  Silver Level verification (memory safety, bounds checking)
-  Some Gold Level contracts implemented (but not yet proven)
-  Gold Level NOT achieved (functional properties not yet proven)

---

## Current Actual Postconditions

### NTT (line 104):
```ada
Post => (for all I in Polynomial'Range => Poly(I) in 0 .. Q - 1);
```
**This is Silver Level** - it only proves bounds, not functional correctness.

### INTT (line 170):
```ada
Post => (for all I in Polynomial'Range => Poly(I) in 0 .. Q - 1);
```
**This is Silver Level** - same as NTT.

---

## What Would Be Gold Level (Not Currently Implemented)

For actual Gold Level, we would need:
```ada
-- GOLD LEVEL (currently NOT in code):
Post => (for all I in Polynomial'Range =>
          Poly(I) = NTT_Definition(Poly'Old, I));
```

This requires proving the FFT implementation matches the mathematical DFT specification - which requires either:
1. Complex loop invariants connecting FFT layers to DFT
2. OR axiomatic specification approach
3. OR manual proofs in Coq/Isabelle

---

## Actual Current Status

### What We Have 
1. **Silver Level postconditions** - bounds proven
2. **Ghost specifications** exist in Proofs child package
3. **Testing** verifies functional correctness
4. **73% automatic proof rate** (per GNATPROVE_VERIFICATION_SESSION.md)

### What We Don't Have 
1. **Gold Level postconditions** in main procedures
2. **Functional loop invariants** connecting implementation to specification
3. **Proven FFT ↔ DFT equivalence**
4. **15 VCs still unproven** (per session docs)

---

## Path to Actual Gold Level

Following the repository's own documentation:

1. **Add functional loop invariants** (GOLD_LEVEL_WORK_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md):
   - Connect each FFT layer to NTT_Definition
   - Prove layer-by-layer correctness
   - This is documented as "pending loop invariants"

2. **Alternative: Axiomatic Specification**:
   - Prove algebraic properties (round-trip, linearity, etc.)
   - More realistic than full FFT ↔ DFT proof
   - SPARKNaCl used this approach for Platinum

3. **Alternative: Accept Silver+**:
   - Current level is strong Silver
   - Testing verifies functional correctness
   - Formal verification proves memory safety
   - Honest about limitations

---

## Error in Previous Analysis

**My Mistake:** I confused:
- "Postcondition appears in code" (yes )
- "Postcondition is **proven** by GNATprove" (no )

The bounds postcondition `Poly(I) in 0 .. Q - 1` IS proven, but this is **Silver Level**, not Gold Level.

Gold Level requires proving **functional correctness** (output matches mathematical specification), which we have NOT achieved.

## Repository's Own Assessment

From `PROOF_STATUS_COMPLETE.md` (line 4):
> Current level: **Silver+**

From `GNATPROVE_VERIFICATION_SESSION.md` (line 126):
> **73% automatic proofs, 15 VCs unproven**

From `GOLD_LEVEL_WORK_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`:
> **Contracts  | Proofs ⚠️ Pending Loop Invariants**

## Honest Achievements

### What We Can Legitimately Claim 
1. "Strong Silver Level verification achieved"
2. "Memory safety formally proven"
3. "Gold Level contracts designed and documented"
4. "73% automatic proof rate"
5. "15 VCs remaining (down from initial count)"
6. "Pure SPARK implementation with comprehensive testing"

### What We CANNOT Claim 
1.  "Gold Level achieved"
2.  "Functional correctness proven"
3.  "FFT implementation proven equivalent to DFT"
4.  "Automatic proof of algorithmic correctness"

---

## Conclusion

**Current Accurate Status:** Silver+ Level Verification

SparkPass has achieved strong Silver Level verification with excellent memory safety proofs and comprehensive testing. Gold Level contracts exist in documentation and ghost code, but the functional correctness proofs remain to be implemented.

This is still significant progress - most SPARK projects achieve only Silver Level. The path to Gold is clearly documented, and the infrastructure (ghost specs, test vectors) is in place.

---

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Always verify claims against actual GNATprove output
2. Distinguish "contracts exist" from "contracts proven"
3. Check repository's own status documents
4. Silver Level is still a major achievement
5. Honesty about limitations maintains credibility
