# Argon2id Test Vector Failure - Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Debugging Strategy Provided

---

## Summary

All 5 RFC 9106 test vectors are failing. After comprehensive analysis against the PHC reference implementation (`/tmp/phc-winner-argon2`), I have verified:

✅ Test vectors are correct (verified against reference)
✅ H0 computation is correct (user-verified)
✅ High-level algorithm logic is mathematically equivalent to reference
✅ G function formula is correct
✅ Fill_Memory XOR logic is correct
✅ Permutation P index patterns match reference

**Conclusion**: The bug is in a **subtle implementation detail**, not the high-level algorithm.

## Test Vector Verification

```bash
$ cd /tmp/phc-winner-argon2
$ echo -n "password" | ./argon2 "somesaltSOMESALTsomesaltSOMESALT" -id -t 4 -m 14 -p 1 -l 32 -r
dbda37811a190cf4dffda38f6aaeef2f2bb74c675d1c333512790d4d902107a3
```

✅ **Matches test vector in test_argon2id_vectors.adb**

**SparkPass output**: `2f52e70f5ce38914...` ❌ **INCORRECT**

---

## What I Verified is CORRECT

### 1. Mathematical Equivalence of G Function

**Reference implementation** (`ref.c` lines 39-81):
```c
// For with_xor=0 (Pass 0):
blockR = Ref ⊕ Prev
block_tmp = Ref ⊕ Prev
P(blockR)  // in-place
Output = block_tmp ⊕ blockR = (Ref ⊕ Prev) ⊕ P(Ref ⊕ Prev)

// For with_xor=1 (Pass 1+):
blockR = Ref ⊕ Prev
block_tmp = Ref ⊕ Prev ⊕ Current
P(blockR)  // in-place
Output = block_tmp ⊕ blockR = (Ref ⊕ Prev ⊕ Current) ⊕ P(Ref ⊕ Prev)
```

**SparkPass implementation** (`fill.adb` + `mix.adb`):
```ada
-- Pass 0:
Output = G(Prev, Ref) = P(Prev ⊕ Ref) ⊕ Prev ⊕ Ref

-- Pass 1+:
temp = G(Prev, Ref) = P(Prev ⊕ Ref) ⊕ Prev ⊕ Ref
Output = temp ⊕ Current = P(Prev ⊕ Ref) ⊕ Prev ⊕ Ref ⊕ Current
```

Since XOR is commutative and associative:
```
P(Prev ⊕ Ref) ⊕ Prev ⊕ Ref ⊕ Current
= Prev ⊕ Ref ⊕ Current ⊕ P(Prev ⊕ Ref)
= (Ref ⊕ Prev ⊕ Current) ⊕ P(Ref ⊕ Prev)  // Reference formula
```

✅ **Mathematically equivalent**

### 2. Permutation P Index Patterns

Both SparkPass and reference apply:
1. First loop: Rows (indices 0-15, 16-31, ..., 112-127)
2. Second loop: Columns (indices 0,1,16,17,...,112,113; then 2,3,18,19,...,114,115; etc.)

✅ **Index patterns match** (Note: Reference comments are misleading - they say "columns" but mean rows and vice versa)

### 3. GB/fBlaMka Function

**Reference** (`blamka-round-ref.h` line 25-29):
```c
static BLAKE2_INLINE uint64_t fBlaMka(uint64_t x, uint64_t y) {
    const uint64_t m = UINT64_C(0xFFFFFFFF);
    const uint64_t xy = (x & m) * (y & m);
    return x + y + 2 * xy;
}
```

**SparkPass** (`mix.adb` lines 82-85):
```ada
A_Lo := A_Mod and 16#FFFFFFFF#;
B_Lo := B_Mod and 16#FFFFFFFF#;
A_Mod := A_Mod + B_Mod + 2 * A_Lo * B_Lo;
```

✅ **Identical** (both extract low 32 bits, multiply, add `a + b + 2*xy`)

### 4. GB Rotation Amounts

Reference: 32, 24, 16, 63
SparkPass: 32, 24, 16, 63

✅ **Match exactly**

### 5. Initial Block Generation

Both generate:
- Block 0: `H'(1024, H0 || LE32(0) || LE32(lane))`
- Block 1: `H'(1024, H0 || LE32(1) || LE32(lane))`

Where H0 is verified correct.

✅ **Logic matches**

---

## Most Likely Bug Locations

Since high-level logic is correct, the bug is in implementation details:

### **Priority 1: Byte Ordering Issues**

#### Location: `/Users/sicarii/SparkPass/src/sparkpass/crypto/sparkpass-crypto-argon2id-init.adb`

**Function**: `Bytes_To_Block` (lines 47-76)

**Current implementation**:
```ada
Offset := W * 8 + 1;

Result (W) :=
   U64 (Bytes (Offset + 0))              or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 1)), 8)  or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 2)), 16) or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 3)), 24) or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 4)), 32) or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 5)), 40) or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 6)), 48) or
   Shift_Left (U64 (Bytes (Offset + 7)), 56);
```

**Reference** (`blake2-impl.h` lines 63-80):
```c
static BLAKE2_INLINE uint64_t load64(const void *src) {
#if defined(NATIVE_LITTLE_ENDIAN)
    uint64_t w;
    memcpy(&w, src, sizeof w);
    return w;
#else
    const uint8_t *p = (const uint8_t *)src;
    uint64_t w = *p++;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 8;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 16;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 24;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 32;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 40;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 48;
    w |= (uint64_t)(*p++) << 56;
    return w;
#endif
}
```

✅ **Looks correct** - both build little-endian U64 from bytes

#### Location: `/Users/sicarii/SparkPass/src/sparkpass/crypto/sparkpass-crypto-argon2id-finalize.adb`

**Function**: `Block_To_Bytes` (lines 63-122)

**Current implementation**:
```ada
Output (Byte_0_Pos) := U8 (Word and 16#FF#);
Output (Byte_1_Pos) := U8 (Shift_Right (Word, 8) and 16#FF#);
Output (Byte_2_Pos) := U8 (Shift_Right (Word, 16) and 16#FF#);
...
```

**Reference** (`blake2-impl.h` lines 97-118):
```c
static BLAKE2_INLINE void store64(void *dst, uint64_t w) {
#if defined(NATIVE_LITTLE_ENDIAN)
    memcpy(dst, &w, sizeof w);
#else
    uint8_t *p = (uint8_t *)dst;
    *p++ = (uint8_t)w;
    w >>= 8;
    *p++ = (uint8_t)w;
    ...
#endif
}
```

✅ **Looks correct** - both write little-endian bytes

### **Priority 2: Array Indexing**

#### Potential Issue: 0-indexed vs 1-indexed arrays

Ada arrays can start at any index. SparkPass uses:
- `Byte_Array (1 .. N)` - **1-indexed**
- `Block (Block_Word_Index)` where `Block_Word_Index is Natural range 0 .. 127` - **0-indexed**

The `Bytes_To_Block` function has:
```ada
Offset := W * 8 + 1;  -- +1 because Bytes is 1-indexed
```

✅ **This is correct** - adds 1 to compensate for 1-indexed array

#### Potential Issue: Off-by-one in HPrime

**Check**: Does HPrime copy the correct number of bytes in each iteration?

Current code (`hprime.adb` lines 117-121):
```ada
--  Copy V_1 (first 32 bytes only, per phc-winner-argon2 reference)
Output (Output'First .. Output'First + 31) := V (1 .. 32);
Out_Offset := 32;
```

✅ **This matches user's fix #4** - copies first 32 bytes of V_1

### **Priority 3: Subtle Logic Bugs**

#### Potential Issue: Fill_Memory segment boundaries

**Check**: Does Fill_Memory correctly handle:
- First segment of first pass (starts at block 2, not 0)
- Segment boundaries
- Pass boundaries

Current code (`fill.adb` lines 157-163):
```ada
if Pass = 0 and Segment = 0 then
   Start_Index := 2;
else
   Start_Index := 0;
end if;

End_Index := Active_Blocks_Per_Segment;
```

✅ **This matches reference** (ref.c lines 121-134)

#### Potential Issue: Reference calculation

**Index calculation** in Fill_Memory calls `Calculate_Reference` which:
1. Determines indexing mode (Argon2i vs Argon2d)
2. Gets pseudo-random value
3. Maps to reference block

This is complex and could have subtle bugs.

---

## Debugging Strategy

### **Step 1: Add Intermediate Value Logging**

Modify Fill_Memory to print intermediate block values and compare with reference:

```ada
-- After initial blocks are generated
Put_Line ("Block 0, Word 0: " & U64'Image (Memory (0)(0)));
Put_Line ("Block 1, Word 0: " & U64'Image (Memory (1)(0)));

-- After first G call in Pass 0, Segment 0, Index 2
Put_Line ("Block 2, Word 0: " & U64'Image (Memory (2)(0)));
```

Compare with reference using:
```bash
# Compile reference with GENKAT defined to print intermediate values
cd /tmp/phc-winner-argon2
make clean
CFLAGS="-DGENKAT" make
./argon2 ... (run test)
```

### **Step 2: Binary Search for Divergence Point**

1. Verify Block 0 matches reference
2. Verify Block 1 matches reference
3. Verify Block 2 matches reference
4. Continue until you find the FIRST block that diverges

This will pinpoint exactly where the bug occurs.

### **Step 3: Examine the G Function Call for That Block**

Once you find the first diverging block, examine:
1. The prev_block value (should match reference)
2. The ref_block value (should match reference)
3. The ref_index calculation (should match reference)
4. The G function output

### **Step 4: Check Blake2 Integration**

If blocks 0 and 1 are wrong, the bug is in:
- H0 generation (user says this is correct)
- HPrime generation
- Bytes_To_Block conversion

If blocks 0 and 1 are correct but block 2 is wrong, the bug is in:
- G function
- Reference index calculation
- Memory indexing

---

## Recommended Fixes

Based on analysis, here are the most likely fixes:

### **No Code Changes Needed (Algorithm is Correct)**

The mathematical formulas are all correct. The bug is almost certainly in:

1. **Byte ordering** - but I verified these match
2. **Array indexing** - but I verified the +1 offset for 1-indexed arrays
3. **HPrime logic** - user says this was fixed
4. **Reference index calculation** - complex, could have subtle bugs

### **Next Action: Instrument and Compare**

The ONLY way to find this bug is to:

1. **Add debug logging** to print intermediate block values
2. **Run reference implementation** with GENKAT to get reference values
3. **Compare** block-by-block to find divergence point
4. **Examine** the specific operation that caused divergence

## Conclusion

The SparkPass Argon2id implementation has **correct high-level algorithm logic**, but a subtle bug in implementation details. The bug is NOT in:

- G function formula
- XOR logic for Pass 1+
- Permutation P
- GB/fBlaMka function
- Rotation amounts

The bug IS in one of:

1. **Reference index calculation** (most complex part, highest risk)
2. **Byte ordering edge case** (least likely, but possible)
3. **Array indexing edge case** (possible off-by-one)
4. **HPrime edge case** (user fixed some issues, might be more)

**Recommended Next Step**: Instrument the code with debug logging and compare intermediate block values against the reference implementation's GENKAT output to find the exact divergence point.
