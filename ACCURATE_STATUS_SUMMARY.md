## What We Actually Accomplished

### ✅ COMPLETED: Gold Level Contract Specifications

**1. Functional Postconditions Added:**
```ada
-- File: src/sparkpass/crypto/sparkpass-crypto-mlkem-ntt.ads

procedure NTT (Poly : in out Polynomial) with
   Post => (for all I in Polynomial'Range => Poly(I) in 0 .. Q - 1)  -- Silver: Safety
           and then
           (for all I in Polynomial'Range =>
             Poly(I) = NTT_Definition(Poly'Old, I));                  -- GOLD: Correctness!

procedure INTT (Poly : in out Polynomial) with
   Post => (for all I in Polynomial'Range => Poly(I) in 0 .. Q - 1)  -- Silver: Safety
           and then
           (for all I in Polynomial'Range =>
             Poly(I) = INTT_Definition(Poly'Old, I));                 -- GOLD: Correctness!
```

**2. Mathematical Specifications Integrated:**
- Ghost functions `NTT_Definition` and `INTT_Definition` declared in NTT.ads
- Import pragma links to implementations in Proofs child package
- Avoids circular dependency through external symbol linking

**3. Compilation Successful:**
- All code compiles without errors
- No syntax issues
- Build artifacts generated successfully

## ⚠️ PENDING: Proof Discharge by GNATprove

### What Still Needs To Be Done:

**1. GNATprove Verification:**
- Run GNATprove on updated NTT module
- Verify that SMT solvers can discharge new postconditions
- Expected result: Either proven automatically OR identification of required loop invariants

**2. Implementation Bridge VCs:**
From previous analysis (GOLD_LEVEL_EXECUTION_PLAN.md):
```
Category 3: Implementation Bridge (2 VCs) - CAN FIX

Locations:
1. Lemma_NTT_Implementation_Correct postcondition
2. Lemma_INTT_Implementation_Correct postcondition

Problem: Connection between FFT implementation and DFT mathematical definition
```

**3. Possible Additional Loop Invariants:**
May need to add loop invariants in NTT.adb and INTT.adb to help GNATprove:
- Invariants relating loop iteration to mathematical specification
- Intermediate assertions connecting Cooley-Tukey steps to DFT evaluation
- Reference to NTT_Definition/INTT_Definition in loop bodies

## The Critical Distinction: Contracts vs. Proofs

### What "Gold Level" Means:

**Specification (Contracts):**
- ✅ We have Gold Level postconditions
- ✅ We specify WHAT the code should do (functional correctness)
- ✅ We reference mathematical specifications

**Verification (Proofs):**
- ⚠️ GNATprove must discharge the new verification conditions
- ⚠️ SMT solvers must prove postconditions hold
- ⚠️ May require additional loop invariants/lemmas

### Current Status:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SILVER LEVEL: Memory Safety           │
│  Status: ✅ PROVEN (73% overall)       │
│  Evidence: VERIFICATION_RESULTS_*.md   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GOLD LEVEL: Functional Correctness    │
│  Contracts: ✅ IMPLEMENTED             │
│  Proofs: ⚠️ PENDING GNATprove         │
│  Evidence: TBD after gnatprove run     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Honest Assessment

### What We Can Claim NOW:

✅ "Gold Level contract specifications implemented"
✅ "Functional correctness postconditions added to NTT/INTT"
✅ "Code upgraded from safety-only to correctness specifications"
✅ "Mathematical specifications integrated into contracts"

### What We CANNOT Claim Yet:

❌ "Gold Level verification achieved"
❌ "Functional correctness proven"
❌ "GNATprove confirms algorithm correctness"
❌ "99%+ proof rate on functional properties"

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (In Progress):
1. **Wait for GNATprove completion** on current run
2. **Analyze results** to see if postconditions are automatically proven
3. **Document VCs** that couldn't be discharged

### If Postconditions Don't Prove Automatically:
1. **Add loop invariants** in NTT/INTT implementation
2. **Add intermediate assertions** connecting loop steps to specification
3. **Reference mathematical spec** in loop bodies
4. **Iterate with GNATprove** until postconditions proven

### If Postconditions DO Prove Automatically:
1. **Document success** in verification report
2. **Update status** to "Gold Level PROVEN"
3. **Calculate new proof rate** including functional properties
4. **Celebrate!** 🎉

## Key Insight: The Two-Stage Process

**Stage 1: Specification (✅ DONE)**
- Write contracts that say WHAT code should do
- This is the "Gold Level specification"
- We completed this stage

**Stage 2: Verification (⚠️ IN PROGRESS)**
- Prove contracts actually hold
- This is the "Gold Level proof"
- GNATprove must confirm our claims

**Analogy:**
- Stage 1 = Writing down the theorem statement
- Stage 2 = Actually proving the theorem
- We've done Stage 1, now doing Stage 2

---

**Conclusion:** We've made significant progress by implementing Gold Level contracts. The next step is proving these contracts hold through GNATprove verification. This is honest, accurate, and shows real engineering progress toward Gold Level formal verification.
