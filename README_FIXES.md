# README.md Fixes - Documentation Accuracy Update

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

README.md has been completely updated to remove all marketing language and fix all documentation inconsistencies. All examples now match the actual behavior of SparkPass.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Marketing Language

**Before**:
```markdown
# SparkPass

**The World's Most Secure Password Manager**
```

**After**:
```markdown
# SparkPass

A quantum-resistant password manager with formally verified security properties.
```

**Before** (end of file):
```markdown
*"The only password manager with mathematical proof of memory safety and quantum resistance."*
```

**After**:
```markdown
Built with Ada/SPARK for formally verified memory safety and quantum resistance.
```

**Impact**: All hyperbolic marketing claims removed. Only factual statements remain.

---

### 2. Fixed Quick Start Examples (Core Issue #2)

**Before** - Showed passwords as CLI arguments (INCORRECT):
```bash
# Create a new vault
./bin/sparkpass_main init ~/passwords.spass "your-secure-password"

# Add a password entry
./bin/sparkpass_main add ~/passwords.spass "your-secure-password" github "MyPassword123"
```

**After** - Shows actual behavior (prompts):
```bash
# Create a new vault (will prompt for password twice)
./bin/sparkpass_main init ~/passwords.spass

# Add a password entry (will prompt for secret, then vault password)
./bin/sparkpass_main add ~/passwords.spass github
```

**Impact**: Users no longer confused about how to use commands. Examples match actual behavior.

---

### 3. Added Password Input Methods Section

**New section** documenting all three methods:

1. **Interactive (default)** - TTY with echo disabled
2. **Stdin pipe/redirect** - For automation and scripts
3. **Environment variable** - For CI/CD and testing

Includes code examples for each method and reference to `NON_INTERACTIVE_USAGE.md`.

**Impact**: Users understand all available password input options.

---

### 4. Fixed Commands Table

**Before** - Showed `<password>` as required argument:
```
| init <vault> <password> | Create new vault with master password (≥12 chars) |
| add <vault> <password> <label> <secret> | Add password entry |
```

**After** - Shows actual behavior (prompts):
```
All commands prompt for passwords securely unless using stdin/environment variable methods.

| init <vault> | Create new vault (prompts for password twice, ≥12 chars) |
| add <vault> <label> | Add entry (prompts for secret, then vault password) |
```

**Impact**: Command reference is now accurate.

---

### 5. Fixed Recovery Workflow (Import Clarification)

**Before** - Misleading claim:
```bash
# Later: recover vault without password
./bin/sparkpass_main import ~/passwords.spass.recovery "new-password"
```

**After** - Accurate description:
```bash
# Later: restore master keys from recovery file
# NOTE: The vault file must still exist for recovery to work
./bin/sparkpass_main import ~/passwords.spass ~/passwords.spass.recovery
# Enter password: (your vault password)
```

**Added IMPORTANT notes**:
- Recovery file contains wrapped master keys, not complete vault backup
- Vault file must exist for import to work
- Keep regular backups of `.spass` vault file

**Impact**: Users understand import limitations and won't expect disaster recovery from recovery file alone.

---

### 6. Added Touch ID Documentation

**New section** documenting biometric authentication:

- First unlock (enrollment) process
- Subsequent unlocks (cached, ~50ms)
- Security properties (two-factor, time-limited, device-bound)
- Build instructions
- Reference to `LACONTEXT_TESTING.md`

**Impact**: Touch ID feature is now documented in main README.

---

### 7. Updated Build Instructions

**Before**:
```bash
Using Alire (recommended):
alr build --release
```

**After**:
```bash
Recommended (includes Touch ID support on macOS):
./build.sh
```

**Impact**: Users know to use `build.sh` to get all features including Touch ID.

---

## Verification

```bash
# No marketing language found
$ grep -n "World's Most\|The only\|World-class" README.md
(no results)
