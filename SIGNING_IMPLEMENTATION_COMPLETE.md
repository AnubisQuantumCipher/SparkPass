## Makefile Targets

### Build Targets

```bash
make build          # Build SparkPass binary
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
make clean-dist     # Remove distribution directory
make install        # Install unsigned binary to /usr/local/bin (dev only)
```

### Release Targets

```bash
make sign           # Sign binary with Hardened Runtime (no notarization)
make release VER=1.0.0    # Complete workflow: build + sign + notarize + staple
make notarize VER=1.0.0   # Alias for 'make release'
make verify         # Verify signatures and notarization
```

### Test Targets

## Workflow Details

### Local Release Workflow

The `make release` command executes the following steps:

1. **Build** (`./build.sh`)
   - Compiles Ada sources with GNAT/GPRbuild
   - Compiles Objective-C LAContext helpers
   - Links with macOS frameworks: LocalAuthentication, Security, Foundation
   - Produces: `bin/sparkpass_main` (4.5MB)

2. **Code Signing**
   - Signs binary with Developer ID Application certificate
   - Applies Hardened Runtime with `--options runtime`
   - Uses entitlements from `signing/sparkpass.entitlements`
   - Adds Apple timestamp

3. **ZIP Distribution**
   - Renames `sparkpass_main` â†’ `sparkpass`
   - Creates: `dist/sparkpass-{version}-macos-{arch}.zip`

4. **ZIP Notarization**
   - Submits ZIP to Apple notary service
   - Waits for approval (2-10 minutes)
   - Saves notarization log

5. **PKG Installer Creation**
   - Creates PKG with install location: `/usr/local/bin/sparkpass`
   - Signs PKG with Developer ID Installer certificate
   - Bundle ID: `com.anubisquantumcipher.sparkpass`

6. **PKG Notarization**
   - Submits PKG to Apple notary service
   - Waits for approval (2-10 minutes)
   - Saves notarization log

7. **Stapling**
   - Staples notarization ticket to PKG
   - Enables offline verification
   - Validates stapled ticket

8. **Verification**
   - Verifies binary signature
   - Verifies PKG signature
   - Checks Gatekeeper acceptance
   - Validates stapled ticket

9. **Output**
   - `dist/sparkpass-{version}-macos-{arch}.zip` (notarized)
   - `dist/sparkpass-{version}-installer.pkg` (notarized + stapled)
   - `dist/notarization-zip-log.json`
   - `dist/notarization-pkg-log.json`

**Total Duration**: 5-20 minutes (depends on Apple's notarization service)

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow automates the entire process:

1. **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch with version input
2. **Runner**: `macos-14` (Apple Silicon)
3. **Steps**:
   - Checkout code
   - Install Homebrew dependencies (liboqs, openssl@3, libsodium)
   - Install Alire and GNAT toolchain
   - Import certificates from GitHub Secrets
   - Configure notarization credentials
   - Build SparkPass
   - Sign, notarize, and staple
   - Verify signatures
   - Test PKG installation
   - Generate checksums
   - Upload artifacts
   - Create GitHub Release
   - Cleanup keychain

**Secrets Required**:
- `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_APP` - Base64-encoded Developer ID Application .p12
- `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_INSTALLER` - Base64-encoded Developer ID Installer .p12
- `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_APPLE_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_TEAM_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD`
  - OR -
- `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_API_KEY`, `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_KEY_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARIZATION_ISSUER_ID`

## Architecture Support

### Single Architecture Builds

The workflow auto-detects the build machine's architecture:

```bash
# On Apple Silicon Mac (arm64)
make release VER=1.0.0
# Creates: sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-arm64.zip

# On Intel Mac (x86_64)
make release VER=1.0.0
# Creates: sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-x86_64.zip
```

### Universal Binary (arm64 + x86_64)

To create a universal binary supporting both architectures:

1. Build on Apple Silicon Mac (arm64)
2. Build on Intel Mac (x86_64)
3. Combine with `lipo`:

```bash
# On Apple Silicon Mac
make release VER=1.0.0 ARCH=arm64
unzip dist/sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-arm64.zip
mv sparkpass sparkpass-arm64

# On Intel Mac
make release VER=1.0.0 ARCH=x86_64
unzip dist/sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-x86_64.zip
mv sparkpass sparkpass-x86_64

# Combine (on either Mac)
lipo -create sparkpass-arm64 sparkpass-x86_64 -output sparkpass-universal

# Verify
lipo -info sparkpass-universal
# Expected: Architectures in the fat file: sparkpass-universal are: x86_64 arm64

# Sign and notarize universal binary
codesign --force --timestamp --options runtime \
  --entitlements signing/sparkpass.entitlements \
  --sign "Developer ID Application: AnubisQuantumCipher (E9VB3VKZKH)" \
  sparkpass-universal

# Create ZIP and notarize
ditto -c -k --keepParent sparkpass-universal sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-universal.zip
xcrun notarytool submit sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-universal.zip \
  --keychain-profile anubis-notary --wait
```

## Distribution Channels

### 1. GitHub Releases (Primary)

**Files to upload**:
- `sparkpass-{version}-macos-{arch}.zip` - Direct download for advanced users
- `sparkpass-{version}-installer.pkg` - Recommended for most users
- `checksums.txt` - SHA256 checksums for verification

**Installation instructions**:
```bash
# PKG Installer (recommended)
curl -LO https://github.com/AnubisQuantumCipher/SparkPass/releases/download/v1.0.0/sparkpass-1.0.0-installer.pkg
sudo installer -pkg sparkpass-1.0.0-installer.pkg -target /
sparkpass --version

# ZIP Archive (advanced users)
curl -LO https://github.com/AnubisQuantumCipher/SparkPass/releases/download/v1.0.0/sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-arm64.zip
unzip sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-arm64.zip
mkdir -p ~/bin && mv sparkpass ~/bin/
chmod +x ~/bin/sparkpass
```

### 2. Homebrew Tap (Optional)

Create a Homebrew tap for easier installation:

**Repository**: `https://github.com/AnubisQuantumCipher/homebrew-sparkpass`

**Formula** (`Formula/sparkpass.rb`):
```ruby
class Sparkpass < Formula
  desc "Quantum-resistant password manager with ML-KEM and ML-DSA"
  homepage "https://github.com/AnubisQuantumCipher/SparkPass"
  url "https://github.com/AnubisQuantumCipher/SparkPass/releases/download/v1.0.0/sparkpass-1.0.0-macos-arm64.zip"
  sha256 "REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_SHA256"
  license "MIT"
  version "1.0.0"

  depends_on :macos
  depends_on arch: :arm64

  def install
    bin.install "sparkpass"
  end

  test do
    assert_match "SparkPass version", shell_output("#{bin}/sparkpass --version")
  end
end
```

**User installation**:
```bash
brew tap anubisquantumcipher/sparkpass
brew install sparkpass
```

### 3. Direct Download (Website)

Host the PKG and ZIP files on your website with installation instructions and SHA256 checksums.

---

## Security Considerations

### Code Signing Chain

1. **Private Key**: Stored in macOS Keychain (never exported)
2. **Developer ID Certificate**: Issued by Apple, valid for 5 years
3. **Binary Signature**: Applied with `codesign` and Apple timestamp
4. **Notarization**: Apple scans for malware, issues ticket
5. **Stapling**: Ticket embedded in PKG for offline verification
6. **Gatekeeper**: macOS validates on first run

### Hardened Runtime

SparkPass uses Hardened Runtime with the following configuration:

**Enabled protections** (from `signing/sparkpass.entitlements`):
- [OK] Disable JIT compilation
- [OK] Disable unsigned executable memory
- [OK] Disable DYLD environment variables
- [OK] Enable library validation
- [OK] No app sandbox (CLI tools don't use sandbox)

**Why these settings?**
- **No JIT**: CLI tools don't need runtime code generation
- **No unsigned memory**: Prevents code injection attacks
- **No DYLD vars**: Prevents library hijacking
- **Library validation**: All loaded libraries must be signed by same Team ID or Apple
- **No sandbox**: CLI tools need filesystem access

### Credential Management

**Local Development**:
- Certificates: Stored in macOS Keychain (encrypted)
- Notary credentials: Stored in Keychain via `notarytool` (encrypted)
- App-specific password: Only used during setup, then deleted

**CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**:
- Certificates: Stored as base64-encoded GitHub Secrets
- Notary credentials: Stored as GitHub Secrets
- Temporary keychain: Created per-build, deleted after
- Credentials: Never logged or exposed in output

### Distribution Security

- **ZIP**: Signed binary inside, notarized by Apple
- **PKG**: Signed by Developer ID Installer, notarized, stapled
- **Checksums**: SHA256 hashes for integrity verification
- **HTTPS**: All downloads from GitHub over HTTPS

Users can verify authenticity with:
```bash
# Verify PKG signature
pkgutil --check-signature sparkpass-1.0.0-installer.pkg

# Verify checksums
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt

# Verify Gatekeeper acceptance
spctl -a -vvv -t install sparkpass-1.0.0-installer.pkg
```

## Maintenance

### Certificate Expiration

Developer ID certificates are valid for **5 years**.

**When certificates expire**:
1. Go to [Apple Developer Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
2. Revoke expired certificates
3. Generate new CSR (or use existing)
4. Create new Developer ID Application and Installer certificates
5. Install new certificates
6. Re-sign and notarize all binaries
7. Update GitHub Secrets with new certificates

### Rotating Notarization Credentials

**App-specific password**:
- Can be revoked and regenerated at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)
- No impact on existing notarized binaries
- Reconfigure with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`

**API key**:
- Can be revoked and regenerated in App Store Connect
- No impact on existing notarized binaries
- Update `.p8` file and reconfigure profile

### Version Updates

For each new release:

```bash
# Update version number
make release VER=1.1.0

# Generate checksums
cd dist && shasum -a 256 *.zip *.pkg > checksums.txt

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v1.1.0 dist/*.zip dist/*.pkg dist/checksums.txt

# Update Homebrew formula (if using)
# - Update version, URL, and SHA256 in Formula/sparkpass.rb
```

### Common Questions

**Q: How long does notarization take?**
A: Typically 2-10 minutes per submission. Apple's service can occasionally be slower.

**Q: Can I test notarization without publishing?**
A: Yes! Run `make release VER=1.0.0` locally. The resulting files are fully notarized but not yet published.

**Q: Do I need both ZIP and PKG?**
A: PKG is recommended for most users (installs to `/usr/local/bin`). ZIP is for advanced users who want manual installation.

**Q: Can I sign without notarization?**
A: Yes, use `make sign`. The binary will work on your Mac but will be blocked on others.

**Q: What if my certificate expires?**
A: Developer ID certificates are valid for 5 years. Renew before expiration. Existing notarized binaries remain valid.

**Q: Can I automate everything with CI/CD?**
A: Yes! The GitHub Actions workflow handles the complete process. See [NOTARIZATION.md](NOTARIZATION.md#cicd-with-github-actions).
