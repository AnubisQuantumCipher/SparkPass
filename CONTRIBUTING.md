[FAIL] **Breaking Changes** without prior discussion
[FAIL] **Non-constant-time** implementations of security-critical code

[FAIL] **Telemetry or analytics** (privacy-first design)

## Security Policy

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Email security reports to: **sic.tau@pm.me**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 48 hours and provide a fix within 7 days for critical issues.

### Security Review Requirements

All cryptographic code changes require:

1. **Peer Review** by at least one cryptography expert
2. **SPARK Verification** (where applicable)
3. **Timing Attack Tests** with <5% variance
4. **Side-Channel Analysis** documentation
5. **References** to academic papers or standards (NIST FIPS, IETF RFCs, etc.)

## Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting a PR

Run the full test suite:

```bash
make test
```

This includes:
- **Cryptographic tests** (ML-KEM-1024, ML-DSA-87)
- **Property-based tests** (vault state machine)
- **Corruption resilience tests** (6 scenarios)
- **Fuzzing tests** (1000 mutations)
- **Timing attack tests** (constant-time validation)
- **Side-channel tests** (cache, branch, memory, spectre)

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Security-critical code**: 100% coverage
- **Cryptographic primitives**: NIST KAT compliance
- **Constant-time operations**: <5% timing variance
- **Error handling**: All error paths tested

### Writing New Tests

Follow existing test patterns in `test/`:
- Use descriptive test names
- Document expected behavior
- Include failure scenarios
- Add security rationale comments

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Prepare Your Changes

```bash
# Update from upstream
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Run tests
make test

# Check SPARK contracts (if applicable)
gnatprove -P sparkpass.gpr
```

### 2. Commit Guidelines

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <summary>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `sec:` Security improvements
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `feat:` New features
- `test:` Test additions
- `docs:` Documentation
- `perf:` Performance improvements

**Example:**
```
sec: Implement constant-time entry lookup

Replace early-exit loop with full iteration to prevent
position-based timing leaks. Always decrypt all entry keys
to eliminate conditional decryption timing variance.

Fixes 18% timing variance discovered in timing attack tests.
See test/test_timing_attacks.adb for validation.

```

### 3. Open Pull Request

**PR Title:** Same as commit summary
**PR Description:** Include:
- What changed and why
- Security implications

### 4. Code Review

Expect reviews focusing on:
- **Cryptographic correctness**
- **Memory safety** (SPARK contracts, zeroization)
- **Constant-time** properties
- **Error handling** completeness
- **Documentation** quality

## Development Tips

### SPARK Mode

SparkPass uses SPARK for formal verification of security-critical code:

```ada
pragma SPARK_Mode (On);

procedure Secure_Operation (Input : Byte_Array)
  with Pre  => Input'Length > 0,
       Post => (for all I in Result'Range => Result (I) = 0);
```

Learn SPARK: https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/spark2014/html/spark2014_ug/

### Constant-Time Programming

Always iterate full length, never early-exit:

```ada
--  [PASS] GOOD: Constant-time
for Index in 1 .. Entry_Count loop
   if Match (Index) then
      Result := Get_Data (Index);
   end if;
   --  NO EXIT - continue to prevent timing leaks
end loop;

--  âœ— BAD: Timing leak
for Index in 1 .. Entry_Count loop
   if Match (Index) then
      Result := Get_Data (Index);
      exit;  -- Leaks position info via timing
   end if;
end loop;
```

### Zeroization

Always wipe secrets on ALL paths:

```ada
declare
   Secret : Key_Array := (others => 0);
begin
   Derive_Key (Secret);
   --  ... use secret ...
   Zeroize.Wipe (Secret);  --  Normal path
exception
   when others =>
      Zeroize.Wipe (Secret);  --  Error path
      raise;
end;
```
